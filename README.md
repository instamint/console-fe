##  🧐 What  is  inside?

​

1.  **`/node_modules`**:  This  directory  contains  all  of  the  modules  of  code  that  your  project  depends  on  (npm  packages)  are  automatically  installed.

2.  **`/public`**:  This  directory  contains  immages  and  fonts  that  use  in  the  project.

3.  **`/src`**:  This  directory  will  contain  all  of  the  code  related  to  what  you  will  see  on  the  front-end  of  your  site  (what  you  see  in  the  browser)  such  as  your  site  header  or  a  page  template.  `src`  is  a  convention  for  “source  code”.

4.  **`.env.`**:  These  files  used  to  store  sensitive  information  such  as  credentials  for  your  app.  Information  typically  should  not  be  seen  by  the  end-user  i.e  database  logic  credentials,  API  keys,  API  endpoints  etc.

5.  **`.gitignore`**:  This  file  tells  git  which  files  it  should  not  track  /  not  maintain  a  version  history  for.

6.  **`.prettierrc`**:  This  is  a  configuration  file  for  [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).  Prettier  is  a  tool  to  help  keep  the  formatting  of  your  code  consistent.

7.  **`deploy.sh`**  This  file  is  a  universal  deployment  script  that  makes  it  easy  for  you  to  deploy  your  code,  files,  configuration  etc.  to  multiple  server  via  ssh.

8.  **`package-lock.json`**  (See  `package.json`  below,  first).  This  is  an  automatically  generated  file  based  on  the  exact  versions  of  your  npm  dependencies  that  were  installed  for  your  project.  **(You  won’t  change  this  file  directly).**

9.  **`package.json`**:  A  manifest  file  for  Node.js  projects,  which  includes  things  like  metadata  (the  project’s  name,  author,  etc).  This  manifest  is  how  npm  knows  which  packages  to  install  for  your  project.

10.  **`tsconfig.json`**: The tsconfig.json file specifies the root files and the compiler options required to compile the project.

11.  **`README.md`**:  A  text  file  containing  useful  reference  information  about  your  project.
